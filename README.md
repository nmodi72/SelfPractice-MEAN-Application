# SelfPractice-MEAN-Application

This project is for self learning of MEAN application. 

- First module, that I started with was Angular. In that, the final module is the latest one. In which, I used AngularJS for the front end purpose which holds the data at page level. 

- Second module was Node, to hold the data at server level I used NodeJS and creating APIs for CRUD operations I used expressJS.

- Third, and final module is Mongo, which enables the application to hold its data at database level. For using this module you will need MongoDB installed on your computer. 
    
    - After that please follow this steps,

        go to the directory where you installed MongoDB, 
        
        > cd ~Path/mongodb-osx-x86_64-enterprise-3.2.8 
        
        then, look for the directory named as data, if you have one delete and recreate it(it will flush the prious db) and then type this command.
        
        > bin/mongod --dbpath data

- To run, Node script in your application go to server folder and 
        
        > npm update 
    
    and then,
    
        > node index.js
